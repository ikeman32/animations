**How to use**

These animations are ready to use as is, to use one of the animations simply rename the class in the html file to the animation you want. You will need to adjust the time of the animation if you want it to last longer.

**Example:**

The default class for the div is set to w3-animate-opacity and is set for 5s (5 seconds). But you want the image to drop down from the top, simply change w3-animate-opacity to w3-animate-top and adjust the time to your desired interval.

**About Less**

The less folder is not specifically needed as it requires the less compiler to use. If you don't use or know what less is you can safely ignore it. The only thing you really need is the css file.

But if you do use less then I have modified the code so that it becomes a parametric mixin with default durations. That way all you have to do is insert the mixin to the appropriate styling in your less files.
